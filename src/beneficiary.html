            <h3>129 Special Needs Pets</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    In 2016, Wright-Way Rescue took on the special needs of over 129 pets. Their care included major orthopedic surgeries, embedded
                    collars, burn victims, severe emaciation cases, broken bones, severe skin infections &amp; mange, and
                    other severe but treatable medical conditions.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Critical Care Center</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Wright-Way Rescue is one of only a few shelters in the nation with a separate medical facility that is dedicated to saving
                    the lives of pets with highly contagious but treatable medical conditions. Instead of turning away pets
                    with illness, we welcome them, and provide the quality medical care needed until they are ready for adoption.
                    Wright-Way Rescue's Critical Care Center has a save rate of 96%!
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Affordable Vet Care</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Wright-Way Rescue operates two low-cost, nonprofit veterinary clinics to serve the pet owning public and those with financial
                    need.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Animal Responsibility</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Wright-Way Rescue follows up closely with our youngest animals who leave on a spay or neuter contract. By ensuring that each
                    pet is altered, we can ensure we are contributing to decreasing the pet overpopulation problem that exists
                    within the US.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Volunteers Save Lives</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    A network of 72 volunteers help Wright-Way Rescue accomplish our lifesaving mission. Volunteers help with every aspect of
                    the rescue's work from dog walking to adoption counseling.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Room to Rescue</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    A network of 72 volunteers help Wright-Way Rescue accomplish our lifesaving mission. Volunteers help with every aspect of
                    the rescue's work from dog walking to adoption counseling.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>No Mom Left Behind</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    In 2016, Wright-Way Rescue took in 118 mommy dogs and their puppies. When Wright-Way commits to a litter of puppies, the
                    mother dog is never left behind regardless of medical condition or special needs.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>87,600 Pounds of Food</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    87,600 pounds of high quality dry dog food and 5,475 cans of dog food is expected to be fed this in the year of 2017.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Community to Save Lives</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Wright-Way Rescue has a network of over 75 lifesaving rescue partners throughout the Midwest that work with us to transport
                    pets to safety.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Rate of Return</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Wright-Way Rescue's return rate is a very low 4%. While our hope is for every pet to work out in their adoptive home, any
                    pet that needs to be returned is welcomed back to ensure their safety. Sometimes unexpected circumstances
                    can occur causing a pet owner the need to relinquish their adopted pet, and sometimes the adoption is
                    simply not the right fit. Whatever the reason, a returned pet is an opportunity for our organization
                    to find that pet their perfect forever home.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Foster Network</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Wright-Way Rescue's foster network consists of over 170 foster families that assist the organization in providing care to
                    the neediest animals, including elderly, nursing, injured, ill, hospice, etc.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Shelter Medicine</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    On-staff veterinarians at each of the three Wright-Way Rescue locations directly oversee the veterinary care of each animal.
                    Wright-Way Rescue employs 5 veterinarians and also partners with a number of outside clinics in order
                    to see to the needs of thousands of pets each year.
